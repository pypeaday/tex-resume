%% If you want to use \orcid or the
%% academicons icons, add "academicons"
%% to the \documentclass options.
%% Then compile with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
% \documentclass[10pt,a4paper,academicons]{altacv}

%% Use the "normalphoto" option if you want a normal photo instead of cropped to a circle
% \documentclass[10pt,a4paper,normalphoto]{altacv}

\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{altacv}

%% AltaCV uses the fontawesome and academicon fonts
%% and packages.
%% See texdoc.net/pkg/fontawecome and http://texdoc.net/pkg/academicons for full list of symbols.
%% I use fontawesome5 instead which can be found http://www.ipgp.fr/~moguilny/LaTeX/fontawesome5Icons.pdf
%% When using the "academicons" option,
%% Compile with LuaLaTeX for best results. If you
%% want to use XeLaTeX, you may need to install
%% Academicons.ttf in your operating system's font %% folder.


% Change the page layout if you need to
\geometry{left=1cm,right=9cm,marginparwidth=6.8cm,marginparsep=1.2cm,top=1cm,bottom=1cm}

% Change the font if you want to.

% If using pdflatex:

\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[default]{lato}

% For footers
%\usepackage{fancyhdr}
%\pagestyle{fancy}
%\fancyhf{}
%\rfoot{Beep, boop, beep}

\usepackage{ragged2e}

% If using xelatex or lualatex:
% \setmainfont{Lato}

% Change the colours if you want to
\definecolor{VividPurple}{HTML}{008080}
