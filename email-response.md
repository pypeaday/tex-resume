Luke and LMG folks,

Thanks you including me in the pool of applicants for the Data Science role at LMG. 
I've been following LTT and related channels for a few years and have been dragged deep into the water of computer building and home labbing.
The announcement of the Data Scientist position got my wife and I pretty jazzed becuase we're big fans of the content and what the material from LMG has enabled me to do at home and at my current job. 
I think it makes fair sense to first say that I'm not necessarily looking to leave my current job but would like to see if the possibility of a remote DS freelance consultant fits into the plans at LMG. 
I've been doing data engineering and data scientist work for 4.5 years at Caterpillar, with the last 2 years obviously being fully remote - much of that experience is captured in my resume - and I've learned that thanks to wonderful age we're in I can do this type of work for anyone from anywhere.
In the last 2 years being fully remote I have been able to successfully coach other data scientists and python programmers within the Cat enterprise through internal group meetings like our "Breakfast and Supper Learn" which is several dozen pythonistas from around the world as well as on my team where I work alongside 4 other data scientists. 
I also have been able to excel at my work because the tools needed for practicing and deploying data engineering/scientist solutions aren't steel and iron that I have to hold in my hand, and they aren't even Excel or a desktop app that someone in an office can look at on my computer, but instead it's cloud computing, automated alerts/notifications from AWS, scheduled pipelines, etc. I've gained confidence in my last 2 years at Cat that I can help someone meet a data need from anywhere with a stable-enough internet connection.

So why am I interested in working with/at LMG then?
I like what I get to work on with Cat but a lot my excitement is related to the tools I get to use, not the data necessarily.
A position with LMG would bring both of those things though - I love bulding computers, learning about hardware, and exploring self-hostable applications at home.
I think working with data from gaming benchmarks, temperatures during a stress test, etc. would be an incredibly fun and fullfilling content-matter to which I can fairly fluently apply data engineering and data science tools and solutions.
I also almost feel like I owe you guys some value - my work from home office space is a very comfortable environment and I owe part of that to what I've learned about cameras, network, wifi and router placement, laptop cooling, and the importance of a slick LTT Northern Lights Desk Pad (ltt store dot com) to bring it all together.

I tried to key achievements in my resume but I'll highlight what I think the important ones are here. 
Between 2 roles at Cat in 2018-2019 I was tasked with designing an end to end machine learning pipeline.
The solution design was entirely up to me as we started with nothing.
What I came up with included deploying python applications in docker which indexed new and existing data (camera/lidar/radar) on an on-prem NAS, applying a deep learning object detection based grooming and cleaning algorithm to filter out unusable data and tag good data with key observations (if a person was present or if a machine was present mainly). The solution included uploading clean datasets to S3 to be used by other groups in Cat working on computer vision applications. The end goal was to enable the creation of deep learning based computer vision and perception systems for on-machine deployment (ie. personnel detection on an autonomous excavator).
I moved on from that position into a group where the data was not images/perception systems but more traditional tabular business data.
In my current role I design ETL pipelines using a framework called Kedro which is 100% FOSS and written in Python. I do some development on my team for custom Kedro utilities and focus a lot on the infrastrucure underlying our Kedro deployment (dockerization, CI/CD, scheduled deployment on AWS Batch).
These 2 roles that I've filled at Cat have given me a lot of experience, and I'd even say some expertise, on designing data pipelines, thinking through and even designing database schemas for efficient relational data storage, and applying data science tools to that data.
